- **Filter**: show All, Active, or Completed tasks
- **Persistent Storage**: tasks saved in your browser (localStorage)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:  
  - `Enter` to add  
  - `Enter` or `Space` to toggle complete

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. Place all three files in the same directory:
    - `index.html`
    - `styles.css`
    - `app.js`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
4. No installation or server required!

## File Structure
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── app.js

- `index.html` – Main HTML file, references external CSS and JS

- `app.js` – App logic, task management, and interactions

## Customization Tips

- Edit the color palette in `styles.css` for your own theme.
